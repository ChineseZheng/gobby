If you want to make changes to gobby, go get hacking. There are no
strict rules considering code style. It's the code that matters, not the
style. Just don't kill me if I reformat your code when applying a patch so
it is consistent with the rest of the file in question.

If you are done with your changes, use `git diff' to create a patch. To
submit it, please open an issue in our trac at
http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/newticket and attach your patch to it.
