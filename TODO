Gobby
=====

Serious:
 * Opening large documents is _really_ slow on win32's timer implementation

Important:
 * Compensate changes made by others by scrolling appropriately, the current
   position should not change

Normal:
 * Menu to switch the syntax colouring scheme.
 * Initialise size of paned widgets
 * configure should detect the presence of gtksourceview automatically
 * Implement a statusbar
   - Cursor position
   - Current highlighting scheme
   - Current syncronisation state 

Minor:
 * Highlighting of own nickname in chat window (Glib::ustring::find)
 * Save document dialog should contain buffer document filename
 * Change the colour of the labels on the notebooks to red if something
   has changed and the document is not active and possibly to grey when
   the document is not yet syncronised (which would depend on sync-on-request
   within libobby)
