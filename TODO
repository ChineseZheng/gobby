43: Bug: Crashes on files with encodings not being UTF-8
--------------------------------------------------------
Gobby should not crash with a segmentation fault when one tries to open 
files not encoded in UTF-8. Instead it should either check the document for 
UTF-8 validity and prompt the user for the right encoding if it does not 
match, and translate it appropriately, or just refuse to open it (but the 
former would be more acceptable than the latter).

45: High CPU load while writing
-------------------------------
If I connect 2 Gobby's on localhost to each other, I see 100% CPU usage 
while writing fast (in fact, punching onto the keys). This looks like a 
severe issue in either the design or implementation to me.

Can be reproduced on Windows and FreeBSD.

48: Bug: High load (and blocking X11) when opening big text file
----------------------------------------------------------------
Opening a 6.7MB large ChangeLog file in gobby produces 100% load and blocks 
gobby completely. Even other windows, like a ssh screen session in an aterm 
did not respond any more. Gobby had to be killed to get the screen session 
working again.

26: Request confirmations for unsaved documents
-----------------------------------------------
Gobby should request a confirmation if you want to quit it and still have 
unsaved documents (#25) open in the session and show a star (*) behind the 
document's name on the tab when a document was changed.

27: Switch to tabs newly opened
-------------------------------
The current selected document should be changed to the one newly opened 
when loading one from a file.

31: Chat command infrastructure
-------------------------------
In order to get the chat more alike to other chats available in the wild 
(like IRC) there should be some commands provider the user might be used 
to, like e.g. /me. Once this framework is implemented in ''Gobby'' it 
should be easy to add new commands.

33: Recognise command line parameters
-------------------------------------
Command line parameters should be parsed and processed. Especially it would 
be nice if Gobby accepted one or more files in it to open it in the 
currently active Gobby session (to use ''Open With'' in your favourite 
desktop environment). However this will get complicated when more than one 
Gobby is open.

51: Write a good README for Gobby
---------------------------------
Gobby needs some documentation. The starting point should be the addition 
of README content. The file is currently present, but empty. It should 
contain at least a description of it, the dependency and a short 
installation guide for *nix systems. More could follow later.

52: Allow opening files as unowned text
---------------------------------------
I think that the default way to open a file should be to open in as 
unhilighted/unowned text, so that changes made to the file are more 
visible.

Possibly there could be something like an "Open file as unhilighted/unowned 
text" checkbox in the open dialog for this?  (Not sure quite how to word 
that to be most understandable by end-user types...)

53: Show the cursors and selections of all participants
-------------------------------------------------------
I think that being able to see the cursors and selections of all the 
participants would help me get a sense for where the other participants 
are, and what they're doing.  I think this would make collaboration a 
little bit easier and more comfortable.

Also, once gobby knows where everyone else is, I think it would be great to 
be able to click on someone's name in the Name List to jump their 
cursor/selection into view.

54: Documentation
-----------------
Gobby should get a normal manual just like other projects. Docbook format 
is preferred. There should be a short introduction with an overview about 
Gobby, an installation guide, some basics about the usage and some 
documentation about the algorithms used.

6: Highlighting of own nickname in chat window
----------------------------------------------
Chat messages of others should be highlighted if the own nickname is 
mentioned in them.

12: Multiple user lists
-----------------------
Put a Gtk::Notebook around the user list and provide 4 user lists:

 * whole session: Display all users that are or were in the session since 
beginning
 * current session: Display all users that are currently in the session
 * whole document: Display all users that are or were subscribed to the 
selected document
 * current document: Display all users that are currently subscribed to the 
selected document

35: Focus the text-widget after having created/joined a session
---------------------------------------------------------------
It would be nice, if one could just create/join a session and then start to 
write without having to focus the editor widget.

59: Colourised tab labels
-------------------------
The tab labels in the notebook holding the documents should be colourised.

The proposed colours are:
 * Grey: The user is not subscribed to this document
 * Black: The user is subscribed to the document and has seen all changes
 * Red: The user is subscribed to the document, it is in the background and 
he has not yet seen all changes
