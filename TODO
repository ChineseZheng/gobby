Modernization:
  Don't use any deprecated GTK+ API anymore
  Replace uris in operations and file tasks by GFile (OperationOpenMultiple should take uris in ctor)
  Move non-window-specific functionality from Window to Application
  Replace GtkUIManager by GApplication/GMenu/GtkBuilder(?) (also ditch ige-mac-integration)
  Replace context menu by GMenu/GtkBuilder?
  Use the Undo interface of GtkSourceBuffer
  Use gsettings to store preferences
  Replace std::auto_ptr by std::unique_ptr, and use move semantics where
    appropriate
  Remove use of stock icons
  Replace Gdk::Color by Gdk::RGBA
  Design widgets and dialogs with Glade, and embed them as gresource
  Replace Gtk::Box and Gtk::Table by Gtk::Grid

Some features that would be nice for a final Gobby 1.0 release. We could
perhaps do pre-releases with some of these missing before:

 - Add base preferences class with Preferences::Option definition to util/,
   inherit in core/, move ClosableFrame to util/
 - Show in tab and userlist when others are typing, using an icon
 - Typing sounds (libcanberra?)

These things need to be implemented in infinote, but again would be nice
to have:

 - Show other user's viewport position in the scrollbar, instead or in addition to cursor position
 - Show what tab another user currently is in
