45: High CPU load while writing
-------------------------------
If I connect 2 Gobby's on localhost to each other, I see 100% CPU usage 
while writing fast (in fact, punching onto the keys). This looks like a 
severe issue in either the design or implementation to me.

Can be reproduced on Windows and FreeBSD.

48: Bug: High load (and blocking X11) when opening big text file
----------------------------------------------------------------
Opening a 6.7MB large ChangeLog file in gobby produces 100% load and blocks 
gobby completely. Even other windows, like a ssh screen session in an aterm 
did not respond any more. Gobby had to be killed to get the screen session 
working again.

91: Gobby adds additional newline on load 
------------------------------------------
Gobby adds an additional newline to the end of the document when a document 
is loaded from the disk. At a first glance only ''Glib::file_get_contents'' 
and ''convert_to_utf8'' are called, so I don't understand where this 
newline is coming from. This happens with stock 0.2.0 and with the current 
development tree, it should also be fixed for the upcoming bugfix release.

31: Chat command infrastructure
-------------------------------
In order to get the chat more alike to other chats available in the wild 
(like IRC) there should be some commands provider the user might be used 
to, like e.g. /me. Once this framework is implemented in ''Gobby'' it 
should be easy to add new commands.

33: Recognise command line parameters
-------------------------------------
Command line parameters should be parsed and processed. Especially it would 
be nice if Gobby accepted one or more files in it to open it in the 
currently active Gobby session (to use ''Open With'' in your favourite 
desktop environment). However this will get complicated when more than one 
Gobby is open.

53: Show the cursors and selections of all participants
-------------------------------------------------------
I think that being able to see the cursors and selections of all the 
participants would help me get a sense for where the other participants 
are, and what they're doing.  I think this would make collaboration a 
little bit easier and more comfortable.

Also, once gobby knows where everyone else is, I think it would be great to 
be able to click on someone's name in the Name List to jump their 
cursor/selection into view.

54: Documentation
-----------------
Gobby should get a normal manual just like other projects. Docbook format 
is preferred. There should be a short introduction with an overview about 
Gobby, an installation guide, some basics about the usage and some 
documentation about the algorithms used.

65: Encoding should be preserved
--------------------------------
The incoming encoding from what it is converted should be saved internally 
on the host which opened them, so that the save function results in a file 
with the original one.

70: automatic scroll if the end of a document is looked at
----------------------------------------------------------
Someone writes new text (usually at the end of the page), but as you don't 
try to scroll all the time you do not realize this. Instead you rest where 
the end of the page was and do not get that new text is added to it. So: If 
the page is scrolled to the end and new lines are added there it should 
automatically scroll down. If you are further up and looking or working on 
something else it shouldn't do so.

71: Win32 Drag'n'Drop
---------------------
The Drag+Drop implementation to drop files into the Gobby window seems not 
to work with  files dragged from the win32 shell (explorer). It does not 
seem that GTK supports this, so we need a raw OLE-based implementation.

72: Newly joined documents are flagged as unchanged
---------------------------------------------------
This can lead to closing unsaved documents without a warning.  Imagine that 
I join a sobby session, and create and edit a new file.  Now if another 
person joins, they will initially have the file flagged as unchanged.  So 
now if the 2nd person closes the file, they (and I!!!) will lose it without 
warning.

Maybe closing a file shouldn't delete it, but instead should just 
unsubscribe you from it?  (It seems kind of bad that someone else can close 
their file that I'm also currently working on, and even if they get a 
warning, I will not.)

73: Visualise connected / subscribed using an extender
------------------------------------------------------
The connected / subscribed flag should be visualised through a nested 
GtkExtender instead of the flags shown up in the ListView. Perhaps it needs 
to be converted to a TreeView to realise this, though.

79: Search, Replace and Goto Line features
------------------------------------------
It would be interesting to have Search, Replace and Goto Line features in 
Gobby.

81: Windows install doesn't work (missing intl.dll)
---------------------------------------------------
"The application has failed to start because intl.dll was not found."

Brand new install of 0.2.1.

82: Central directory support
-----------------------------
Gobby should support a central directory of Sobby servers.

83: UI: Closing documents should not close them for other people
----------------------------------------------------------------
Presently, if one person closes a document, it closes for all other users, 
even if they haven't saved copies. 

Instead, the set of open documents should be a server feature, and each 
client should be able to choose which documents they're subscribed to.

84: End-of-document cursor position behaves weirdly.
----------------------------------------------------
Scenario:

Person A is appending to the end of the document.  Person B wants to add 
something below what person A is now typing.  So, person B positions their 
cursor at the end of the document, and hits enter.  This inserts a newline, 
and causes person A's cursor to go to the position after the newline.  
Instead, person A's cursor should remain before the newline, so that they 
can continue typing on their portion of the document.

87: Gobby should save backups
-----------------------------
Gobby should save local backups in case of crashes.  

88: obby:// protocol handler
----------------------------
Gobby should register itself as a handler for the obby:// protocol. Like 
this sites could link to obby servers for live sessions.

93: "Quit" should confirm
-------------------------
When you close a session, Gobby should warn if you try to close unsaved 
documents.

96: Make it harder to lose document changes
-------------------------------------------
Currently one gets the following message when clicking on 'close document': 
"The document.. has been changed since it was saved to disk. Are you sure 
that you want to close it?" The default user operation of clicking ok now 
loses data! Notepad's "Save changes? Yes/no/cancel" dialog is prob what we 
should stay consistent with.

Trying to exit gobby is even worse; no check for unsaved data is performed. 
This is related to #93.

92: Title bar
-------------
There is a problem with the title bar on the Windows version of gobby 
related to document titles.
When you connect to one server and open a document and disconnect from that 
server, and possibly connecting to another server, then the titlebar still 
shows the old document name from the previous server.

66: Indicate activity by changing tab colour to the user colour
---------------------------------------------------------------
The tabs of documents not active should flash with the colour of the user 
who did the last edit, either temporarily or permanent. This should be 
customisable. When many user edit the document, the tab colour might change 
pretty fast and if someone is editing the document alone there could be a 
blinking dot to indicate the changes.

75: Remote document browsing support
------------------------------------
It would be great if there were a checkbox on the file tab (besides the 
file name) or on the list that shows subscription, that allows me to browse 
the document with the other side cursor. 

This way, one would be able to show document parts to the others without 
hassle and pair programming with gobby would be improved.

(Depends on #53)

76: Session Management
----------------------
I noticed there is a revision number displayed in gobby, there should be a 
way of managing gobby sessions, like loading old revisions and undoing 
changes based on revision as well as saving sessions so they can be loaded 
later on with the changes made by each user retained.

80: Hyperlinks on chat sessions
-------------------------------
Links on chat could be transformed to hyperlinks and sent to the O.S. to be 
opened by the default browser.

85: Server exit causes clients to exit
--------------------------------------
When a server disconnects, clients shouldn't exit (potentially losing 
text).  Instead, they should just indicate to the user that they are 
disconnected, and allow them to save and continue editing text.  If the 
server comes back online, everyone's changes can be sent in.

90: Chat background filled with user colours
--------------------------------------------
The background of lines in the chat box should be colour-coded with the 
colour of the user who wrote them.

95: Locate participants
-----------------------
A flag of the color of the participant which indicates where is he/she 
writing.

98: Automatic live storage of documents and chat logs 
------------------------------------------------------
Gobby should publish documents and chat logs to a web page so that people 
who don't have the Gobby software can still read the ongoing document and 
conversation.  It could do this by saving to a local filesystem in a 
specified location, or by webdav, or possibly by some other means.
