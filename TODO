2: Improve the network handling on Win32
----------------------------------------
Opening large documents is ''really'' slow on the timer implementation in 
use on Win32. Currently the connection is polled every 400ms, which is 
certainly not optimal.

17: Implement support for Zeroconf
----------------------------------
''Zeroconf'' (also known as Apple Bonjour) is a technology to discover 
local network services. The Gobby host may announce itself as a network 
service which could be browsed by other clients on the local subnet. The 
listing and delisting is implemented with the use of multicast DNS and 
happens automatically. ''libobby'' contains an abstraction to the ''howl'' 
implementation of this protocol.

 * We need to add a linking exception for ''howl'' to ''libobby'' (#18).
 * We need a UI implementation of ''Zeroconf'' within ''Gobby's '' join 
dialog.
 * We need proper integration into the GUI main loop on Linux (possibly 
eliminating the necessity to start mDNSResponder prior to a ''howl'' using 
application).

25: A flag specifing if a document has changed
----------------------------------------------
A flag should be implemented which specifies if the document has changed 
since the last save. It should be reset when it is saved to disk and 
changed as soon as the first change (local and non-local) is received and 
put into the text buffer.

26: Request confirmations for unsaved documents
-----------------------------------------------
Gobby should request a confirmation if you want to quit it and still have 
unsaved documents (#25) open in the session. 

27: Switch to tabs newly opened
-------------------------------
The current selected document should be changed to the one newly opened 
when loading one from a file.

31: Chat command infrastructure
-------------------------------
Chat command infrastructure (like /me, /ignore, etc.)

''This is a stub and generated out of the old TODO located in the 
repository.''

32: Strive for Gnome HIG compilance
-----------------------------------
Gobby should be more or less compilant to the Gnome Human Interface 
Guidelines when compiled ''--with-gnome''. This means at least that the 
menu names have to be fixed and some other UI things tweaked a bit.

33: Recognise command line parameters
-------------------------------------
Command line parameters should be parsed and processed. Especially it would 
be nice if Gobby accepted one or more files in it to open it in the 
currently active Gobby session (to use ''Open With'' in your favourite 
desktop environment). However this will get complicated when more than one 
Gobby is open.

36: Colour presets
------------------
There should be presets for the user's colour available in the Gobby 
settings. Probably the colour picker needs to be extended with a palette.

Tom did some research on this and found some useful colours (in HTML hex 
values):
{{{
#!html
<span style="background-color:#f9dad4;">#f9dad4</span>
<span style="background-color:#fddfbe;">#fddfbe</span>
<span style="background-color:#fdf3be;">#fdf3be</span>
<span style="background-color:#f5fdbe;">#f5fdbe</span>
<span style="background-color:#dcfdbe;">#dcfdbe</span>
<span style="background-color:#befde2;">#befde2</span>
<span style="background-color:#bee9fd;">#bee9fd</span>
<span style="background-color:#becffd;">#becffd</span>
<span style="background-color:#c7befd;">#c7befd</span>
<span style="background-color:#f2befd;">#f2befd</span>
<span style="background-color:#fdbedd;">#fdbedd</span>
<span style="background-color:#f6abab;">#f6abab</span>
}}}

37: Format strings for texts to translate
-----------------------------------------
We should use format strings instead of just catting strings togeather to 
permit translators to change word order. Maybe a wrapper around 
''g_sprintf_strdup''.

6: Highlighting of own nickname in chat window
----------------------------------------------
Chat messages of others should be highlighted if the own nickname is 
mentioned in them.

12: Multiple user lists
-----------------------
Put a Gtk::Notebook around the user list and provide 4 user lists:

 * whole session: Display all users that are or were in the session since 
beginning
 * current session: Display all users that are currently in the session
 * whole document: Display all users that are or were subscribed to the 
selected document
 * current document: Display all users that are currently subscribed to the 
selected document

23: Auto indentation
--------------------
GtkSourceView seems to support auto indentation. Gobby should provide an 
option to enable or disable this feature.

35: Focus the text-widget after having created/joined a session
---------------------------------------------------------------
It would be nice, if one could just create/join a session and then start to 
write without having to focus the editor widget.

38: Document owners
-------------------
Document should store their author. This would allow two possibilites:

 * The owner can give different people privilegies to access his document, 
such as ''none'', ''read'', ''read/write''.
 * The document itself is no longer identified by its ID but by its ID 
'''and''' the ID of the document owner. This allows that a document appears 
immediately on the client side without waiting for server acknowledegment 
because the identifications for a document cannot conflict.
