Gobby
=====

Serious:
 * Opening large documents is _really_ slow on win32's timer implementation
 * On connection loss: give a chance to save everything

Important:
 * Compensate changes made by others by scrolling appropriately; the current
   position should not change

Normal:
 * Menu to switch the syntax colouring scheme.
 * Initialise size of paned widgets
 * configure should detect the presence of gtksourceview automatically
 * Prompt before overwriting existing files when explicitly choosing path
 * Chat command infrastructure (/me, /ignore)

Minor:
 * Highlighting of own nickname in chat window (Glib::ustring::find)
 * Change the colour of the labels on the notebooks to red if something
   has changed and the document is not active and possibly to grey when
   the document is not yet syncronised (which would depend on sync-on-request
   within libobby)
 * Option to disable line numbers with GtkSourceView per document
 * Keyboard shortcuts

Wishlist:
 * Default to save files to the location they were loaded from
   (or save the directory of the last save)
