1. Introduction

   This is a brief installation guide for Gobby, the
   collaborative editor. It is a very preliminary version and you
   could find updated information on
   http://darcs.0x539.de/trac/obby/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/Installa
   tionGuide. Help in crafting good documentation is urgently
   needed.

2. Microsoft Windows

2.1. Binary build

   Gobby's binary build needs at least Windows 2000 to run
   correctly. In order to install it on Microsoft Windows to need
   to take the following steps:

     * Download
       http://www.pcpm.ucl.ac.be/~gustin/win32_ports/binaries/gtk
       mm-runtime-2.6.2-1.exe (if it is no more available please
       refer to
       http://www.pcpm.ucl.ac.be/~gustin/win32_ports/gtkmm.html
       to obtain a newer copy); use the downloaded package to
       install Gtkmm, it will in turn download Gtk+ if it is not
       yet installed
     * Download
       http://darcs.0x539.de/gobby-dist/Output/gobby_setup.exe
       and use it to install Gobby

2.2. Development environment

   It is currently not advised to build a development environment
   under Microsoft Windows. If you still want to do so please
   refer to the information on the Wiki.

3. Linux

   Gobby may be installed just like most other application for
   Unix-like operating systems. You need to get the tarballs of
   net6, obby and gobby from http://darcs.0x539.de/ first. Then
   you need to build them in this order by running ./configure,
   make and make install. Please look at the README files of all
   packages to retrieve the dependency list.

   There are also some packagaing systems by some distributions
   which allow the installation of Gobby directly:

3.1. Gentoo Linux

   Thanks to Gustavo Felisberto, Portage contains ebuild for
   net6, obby and gobby. Just use the following command to
   install it (but please note that you have to replace x86
   corresponding to your architecture):

   ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86" emerge gobby

3.2. Debian GNU/Linux

   Gobby is included in Debian unstable. Packages for Sarge are
   published separately and could be used by putting the
   following line into your /etc/apt/sources.list.

   deb http://releases.0x539.de/ debian/

   For Ubuntu you could substitute debian/ with ubuntu/.

4. Mac OS X

   Because of Gobby's dependencies it is still a bit tricky to
   compile it on Mac OS X. Please be aware that Gobby does not
   use Mac OS X's native interface but instead depends on Apple's
   X11 as the windowing toolkit is uses is not (yet?) ported
   natively to Mac OS X. The instructions on
   http://darcs.0x539.de/trac/obby/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/HowToGob
   byFromSourceMacOSX will be kept up-to-date and are usable, but
   lengthy.

5. FreeBSD

   net6, obby and Gobby should compile as is on FreeBSD, but you
   might need to relocate some pkg-config control files after the
   installation of the libraries.

   cp /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/net6-1.1.pc \
     /usr/local/libdata/pkgconfig/

   cp /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/obby-0.2.pc \
     /usr/local/libdata/pkgconfig/
