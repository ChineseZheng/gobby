1. Introduction

   This is a brief installation guide for Gobby, the
   collaborative editor. It is a very preliminary version and you
   could find updated information on
   http://gobby.0x539.de/installationguide.html. Help in crafting
   good documentation is urgently needed.

2. Microsoft Windows

2.1. Binary build

   Gobby's binary build needs at least Windows 2000 to run
   correctly. You could obtain it on
   http://gobby.0x539.de/download.html. Further information could
   be retrieved from the already mentioned installation guide.
     _________________________________________________________

2.2. Development environment

   It is currently not advised to build a development environment
   under Microsoft Windows. If you still want to do so please
   refer to the information in the guide on the wiki.

2.3. Known limitations

   Gobby does not yet support ZeroConf server autodiscovery on
   Windows.

3. Linux

   You should look for Gobby in the package list of your
   favourite version first. However, as major versions are likely
   to be incompatible you might still be required to install
   Gobby from source. Please check your distribution manuals how
   to install the development headers of the required
   dependencies.

   Gobby may be installed from source just like most other
   application for Unix-like operating systems. You need to get
   the tarballs of net6, obby and gobby from
   http://darcs.0x539.de/ first. Then you need to build them in
   this order by running ./configure, make and make install.
   Please look at the README files of all packages to retrieve
   the dependency list.

4. Mac OS X

   The only supported method to install Gobby is via DarwinPorts
   (http://darwinports.org). Please refer to the installation
   guide for more information.

5. FreeBSD

   net6, obby and Gobby should compile as is on FreeBSD, but you
   might need to relocate some pkg-config control files after the
   installation of the libraries.

   cp /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/net6-1.1.pc \
     /usr/local/libdata/pkgconfig/

   cp /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/obby-0.2.pc \
     /usr/local/libdata/pkgconfig/
